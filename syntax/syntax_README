Files must be run in order i.e., 01, 02, 03, etc.

  - File 01 brings data into R & cleans it for use

  - File 02 estimates power law scaling coefficients in the degree distributions
  
  - File 03 tests whether degree distributions vary by comparison to Poisson distributions
  
  - File 04 computes small world statistics
  
  - File 05 estimates hierarchical scaling coefficients to evaluate hierical or lateral network structure
