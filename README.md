# Criminal-networks
For this project, I've computed ready-to-use synthetic criminal networks from published tie data (see: https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets and https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks). I use the local-level configurations from observed networks to simulate comparison networks for use in other research.

As I generate R code for this project, I'll share it.
