# Criminal-networks
A project where I'm generating ready-to-use network graphs in R and global statistics from publically available social network data collected on criminal networks. Many of these network data are publically available at https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets. My purpose here is to use the the global statistics calculated from these network data to generate synthetic control groups.

I'll share my R code as I generate it.
