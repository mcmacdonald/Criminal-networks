# Criminal-networks
For this project, I'm computing ready-to-use synthetic criminal networks from published networks (see: https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets and https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks). To do so, I'm using the local statistics calculated from observed networks to simulate comparison networks for general use.

As I generate R code for this project, I'll share it.
